SATIVA v0.9-57-g8a99328, released on 2017-07-15. Last version: https://github.com/amkozlov/sativa 
By A.Kozlov and J.Zhang, the Exelixis Lab. Based on RAxML 8.2.3 by A.Stamatakis.

SATIVA was called as follows:

../sativa.py -s sim_full_sorted_head500.phy -t true_converted_sorted_head500.tax -x BAC -T 2

*** STEP 1: Building the reference tree using provided alignment and taxonomic annotations ***

=> Loading taxonomy from file: true_converted_sorted_head500.tax ...

==> Loading reference alignment from file: sim_full_sorted_head500.phy ...

===> Validating taxonomy and alignment ...

====> Building a multifurcating tree from taxonomy with 500 seqs ...

=====> Building the reference alignment ...

======> Saving the outgroup for later re-rooting ...

=======> Resolving multifurcation: choosing the best topology from 1 independent RAxML runs ...

========> Calling RAxML-EPA to obtain branch labels ...

=========> Post-processing the EPA tree (re-rooting, taxonomic labeling etc.) ...

==========> Saving the reference JSON file: ./true_converted_sorted_head500.refjson

*** STEP 2: Searching for mislabels ***

Running the leave-one-sequence-out test...

Leave-one-out test identified 3 suspicious sequences; running final EPA test to check them...

Mislabeled sequences by rank:
Genus       :	2

Total mislabels: 2 / 0.40 %
