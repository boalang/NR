* Folder on XSEDE: ``` /pylon5/mc5fr5p/hbagheri/09_Hadoop/seqCount2Jun132019```

## Steps
* in this flder part-r-00000 is the Boa output query.
* then it is being converted to part-r-00000_converted that has protein sequences **that has more than 1 distinct taxa. with one taxa we can not create a Phylogeny tree to check the LCA.**

* what is the ```part-r-00000_converted_1col_sorted_filtered```
